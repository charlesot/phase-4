# DSF-PT08P3- Phase 4 project 
#  Novelle Movies Recommendation  system Project Summary 

## 1. project overview 
 Unlike established streaming services, small businesses in Kenya that sell movies have high customer churn and dissatisfaction rates because they cannot recommend movies to their customers. The business owners have to watch all the movies to give recommendations, this not only wastes time but also  increases missed opportunities to sell movies that the vendor has never watched. 
 The Novelle Movies recommendation system project will develop a personalized movie recommendation system that will enable small business owners to improve sales and retention of their customers through improved customer experience

## 2. Business understanding
* Small businesses in Kenya that sell movies have high customer churn and dissatisfaction rates.
* They spend a lot of time watching all the movies to give recommendations.
* They miss opportunities to sell movies that vendors have never watched.
* They have limited resources to develop a personalized movie recommendation system.
  
### Project objectives 
* Increase customer engagement by recommending movies based on user preference 
* Increase sales by supporting customers to find movies of their taste 
* Be able to make recommendations to new customers
  
### Key features of Novelle Movie recommendation system 
* Collaborative filtering (SVD) for personalized recommendations for existing active users 
* Content-based filtering  using movie genre and tags to handle new users
* Hybrid system  that combines both methods  for the best recommendation 

## 3. Data understanding

The project will use the MovieLens small dataset from the GroupLens research lab at the University of Minnesota. It contains 100,863 ratings and 3683 tag applications on 9742 movies. It was created by 610 users between March 29, 1996, and september 24, 2018. The dataset was generated on September 26, 2018,  and is available for download at http://grouplens.org/datasets/.

### Variables
The MovieLens small dataset has the following 
* Movies.csv which contains the movie details (movieId, title, genres)
* ratings.CSV which contains user ratings (userId, movieId, rating, timestamp)
* tags.CSV contains user-generated movie tags (userId, movieId, tag, timestamp)

## 4. Data preparation 
### Import the Python libraries to use 
import pandas as pd 
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from surprise import SVD, Dataset, Reader, SVDpp
from surprise.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_validate
from surprise import accuracy
from collections import defaultdict
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import linear_kernel
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline 

### Load the dataset  
Dataset if downloaded from http://grouplens.org/datasets/ and loaded into pandas data frames
movies_df = pd.read_csv(r'./Data\movies.csv')
tags_df = pd.read_csv(r'./Data\tags.csv')
ratings_df = pd.read_csv(r'./Data\ratings.csv')

### Exploration  
* The ratings_df, tags_df, and movies_df  data frames were explored to see the first five rows, the information, shape, missing entries, and the number of unique users and movies.
* The column timestamp dropped because it was not being used
* All tags converted to lowercase 
* All the tags per movie aggregate
* The movies_df and the tag_df merged on movieID column
* All Nan features filled with an empty string
* "genre" and "tags" combined to form one feature  a "combined_feature"
* The modified movies_df is merged with the ratings_df  to form merged_df dataframe which will be used in development of the model 
* merged_df data frame is further explored to identify the top ten rated movies, the distribution of the movie rating, the 10 most rated movies, and the distribution number of ratings per user
  
## 5. Modelling
### Collabotarive filtering (SVD) modeling 
* Used Surprise SVD to predict user preferences: data split into training and testing with test_size of 0.2 and random _state of 42 . training of the model used n_factor of 50 
* Model evaluates using root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE)
* function developed to get movie recommendations using  SVD
MAE:  0.5781
RMSE: 0.7500
### Content-based filtering 
 * The TF_IDF and cosine similarity to recommend movies based on combined features

### Hybrid recommendation 
* Hybrid recommendation system combines collaborative filtering (SVD) and content-based filtering.
    If the user has rated at least 5 movies, use collaborative filtering (SVD).
    If the user has rated less than 5 movies, use content-based filtering and recommend the top-rated movie.
    If the user has not rated any movies, recommend the top-rated movies to address the cold start problem
  
## 6. Model improvement: Hyperparameter Tuning 
* GridSearchCV was used to improve performance but it shoed no change in performance .
Best RMSE parameters: {'n_factors': 150, 'n_epochs': 30, 'lr_all': 0.005, 'reg_all': 0.1}
Best MAE parameters: {'n_factors': 150, 'n_epochs': 30, 'lr_all': 0.005, 'reg_all': 0.1}
MAE:  0.5781
RMSE: 0.7500
* SVDpp Used ..showed minimal improvement despite using lots of computational resources 
RMSE: 0.7206
MAE:  0.5518
